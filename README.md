# Logging and Security Assignments

This repository contains three assignments designed to help you practice structured logging, secure handling of PII data, traceability, and building a secure login system with proper authentication and authorization.

---

## Assignment 1: Secure and Structured Logging

**Objective:**  
Implement structured logging in any backend project of your choice. Ensure all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as Aadhaar, PAN, phone numbers, and emails are masked before logging. Include traceability fields like requestId, userId, eventType, timestamp, serviceName, and functionName in all logs.

**What you will learn:**  
- Structured JSON logging  
- Masking sensitive data in logs  
- Adding traceability metadata for debugging and audit

## Assignment 2: Database Design for Log Storage

**Objective:**  
Design a relational database schema to securely store structured log data with masked PII and traceability information. The schema should support efficient querying by requestId, userId, eventType, and timestamp.

**What you will learn:**  
- Database schema design for logs  
- Indexing strategies for efficient searches  
- Best practices for storing masked sensitive data

## Assignment 3: Secure Login System with Auth and Logging

**Objective:**  
Build a secure login system with authentication and authorization using either open-source identity providers like Keycloak or your own implementation. The system must log all user activities without logging any PII and implement proper input validation.

**What you will learn:**  
- Authentication and role-based authorization  
- Secure password handling  
- Logging user activities with PII protection  
- Input validation and security best practices
